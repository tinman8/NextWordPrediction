This repo contains the code for the Coursera Data Science Specialization capstone project. This repo does not contain the R objects required to run the code. The R objects need to be created and saved into the relevant folder for the code to run. It is separated into 3 folders:

#### App

Contains all the code for the ShinyApp. For this application to work, the model needs to be built. This can be done by following the code in the model.RMD file in the model folder.

The live app can be found:
